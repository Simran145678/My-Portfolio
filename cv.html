        <h3 class="cv-h3">Hi, Iâ€™m Harsimran. Nice to meet you.</h3>
        <p class="cv-paragraph">
          I'm a multi talented individual with degree in Computer Engineering,
          looking for an opportunity to work as a web developer. <br /><br />

          I did Bachelors degree in Computer Applications in India and a
          Software Engineering diploma in Canada. Throughtout my learning years,
          I have worked on various programming languages. Along with that I have
          also studied data structures and algorithms. <br /><br />
          The reason I choose to become a web developer is because it seems
          really fun to me. It allows to use creativity along with logic and I
          really enjoy experimenting with designs and bringing innovations to
          them.
          <br /><br />
          Besides that, my favourite hobbies are painting, reading books and
          dancing.<br />
          <br />
          Apart from that, my career is the first priority for me.
          <span>110 % </span> dedication to my job is gurranted. And also, I
          have Permanent Residency confirmed that means I will not be needing
          any assistance for that purpose.<br />
