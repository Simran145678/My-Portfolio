      <h3 class="cv-h3"><u>In Breif</u></h3>
      <p class="cv-paragraph">
        <span class="cv-list-item-bold">Education and Interests</span><br />
        As mentioned previously, I have been studying Computer Science and
        Engineering for over 5 years. I hold a Bachelor's degree and a diploma.
        My majors in High School were Science and Maths. It will not be wrong to
        say that I have developed a technical brain. Throughout my educational
        period, since kindergarten, MATHS has remained my favourite subject and
        second favourite was science.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have always enjoyed solving and simplifying equations, finding Xes and
        Ys and practicing fast calculations. I find the same pleasure in doing
        programming as I use to find in studying maths. And this makes me
        believe that I have choosen the best career for myself.
      </p>
      <p class="cv-paragraph">
        <span class="cv-list-item-bold">Personality</span><br />
        I dont want to sound like self praising myself but, I have a very
        optimistic and cheerful persona and it makes it really easy for me to
        make friends and adjust at any new place very comfortably. I am a fun
        person to be around and everyone enjoys being in my company.
        <br />
        <br />
        Usually calm all the times, I am a person who can be trusted all the
        times. Not just in relationships and friendships but also in work and
        perfection. Whether it be a class assignment or a national level
        competition, I always desired to perform my best and stand out of
        others. And to reach perfection in any work I do, I tend to stay utterly
        dedicated and devoted.
      </p>
      <p class="cv-paragraph">
        <span class="cv-list-item-bold">Experience</span><br />
        Being honest, I do not have industry experience. Instead, I have enough
        caliber, knowledge, skills and confidence to start my career as a web
        developer right now. I am quick learner and I know my capabilities and I
        am confident that once given a chance, I will absorb the industry
        standards and working in no time.

        <br />
        <br />
        Apart from that, I have been working in walmart as Customer Experience
        Associate for over 2 years. Talking to customers, listening to their
        complaints and demands is a regular thing for me. And I on the other
        hand try my bestest best to resolve their issues, guide them and make
        them feel good for choosing our store. Seeing customer happy and
        satisfied boosts my confidence and inspires me to keep doing the good
        work. Hence, I can say I have great communication skills too.
      </p>
      <p class="cv-paragraph">
        <span class="cv-list-item-bold">Hobbies</span><br />
        My favourite hobby is drawing and painting. I love to play with colours.
        I also have won 3 national level certificates in it. Besides that, I
        also like dancing and reading-books. I am not a fan of romatic tales. I
        like thriller or anything based on life lessons. Being a punjabi,
        Bhangra(punjabi folk dance) is the dance form I am proficient in. So,
        when I have nothing to do, Bhangra is what I do. It just makes me feel
        happy.
